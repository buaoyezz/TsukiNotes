Dear User,

Thank you for using this software.

You are currently looking at the Log folder.

Please note the following:
1. Logs are usually stored in the temp folder.
2. The log files have a .log extension.
3. Log file names follow this format: TsukiNotes_Log_{timestamp}.log, where {timestamp} is in the format datetime.now().strftime().
4. This text file is not pre-existing but is created automatically!
5. Thanks for using our software.
